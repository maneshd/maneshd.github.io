            Hi! Iâ€™m Danny -
            <span class="biz">
              a software engineer, musician, and HCI researcher.
            </span>
            <span class="cazh" hidden>
              a software engineer, musician, neophyte HCI researcher,
              wannabe-creative, and overall silly human.
            </span>
            I'm a <span id="da-year">first-year</span> PhD student in computer science
            at Virginia Tech, advised by
            <a href="https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/">Sang Won Lee</a>.
            In broad strokes, I am interested in creative
            technologies (especially related to music), CS education, and
            software engineering in general. My current research threads involve:
            building a tool for non-programmers to do simple data analyses; and
            exploring how
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding" target="_blank">
              live coding
            </a>
            musicians keep track of their programs over time.
            </p>

            <p>
            I previously worked as a software engineer at
            <span class="biz">Google</span>
            <span class="cazh" hidden>
              "The big <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">G</a>"
            </span>
            for ~5 years, but decided to jump ship and head to academia.
            Before that, I did an M.Eng at MIT, where I TA-ed algorithms courses
            <span class="cazh" hidden>(I &lt;3 algorithms!)</span> and worked on a
            playful application for collaborative musical composition<span class="cazh" hidden> (which they let me use as a thesis!)</span>.
            Before that, I was an undergrad at MIT, where I did a double major in
            computer science and music. During my time at MIT, I gave several
            piano recitals and chamber music performances.
